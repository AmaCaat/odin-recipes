        <p>Pulpo a feira also known as <em>Polbo รก feira</em> is a one of the spanish famous tradition foods and it means "fair-style octopus". Tough it was originally from Galicia, Spain, it got spread by way its delicious and unique taste and now is popular and eaten troughout the whole country.</p>
        <p>This is very easy to make and with only few ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Recipe tutorial</h2>
            <p>Frozen octopus works particularly well, since the freezing tenderizes the otherwise quite tough meat, so that is what I suggest you use here. If you prefer to use a fresh octopus, you will need to practice the almost tribal tradition of beating the animal with a rock or meat mallet to rid of its rubbery texture. Another option is to freeze fresh octopus for about two weeks to tenderize it.</p>

            <li>Prepare octopus and cut into pieces</li>
            <li>Boil a large stockpot and add salt</li>
            <li>Dip octopus to the boiling water and take it out so it pot return to boil (4 times)</li>
            <li>Then submerge the octopus and let it be for 2 hours until its tender</li>
            <li>Turn off heat and let the octopus take a breath for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Divide the octopus pieces and potatoes evenly among 6 plates</li>
            <li>Drizzle them with paprika, olive oil and you can add some spices of your choice to finish the taste.</li>
            <li>Eat when octopus and potatoes still warm</li>
